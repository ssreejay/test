            <p>Attention to theory in program evaluation has focused predominantly on program theory and few evaluation practitioners have received formal training in evaluation theory. It is important not to confuse these two terms. The latter is an approach or model which offers prescriptions for evaluation (e.g. what evaluation is, how it ought to be done, with whom, in what contexts and to what affect). The former examines the causal links between program activities and outcomes.</p>

            <p>As Christie (2003) notes, lack of attention to evaluation theory can be explained in part by the fact that many people who conduct evaluation are not evaluators but rather their primary identity is with some other field. She explains that:</p>

            <p class="blockquote">&hellip;today's evaluators may not use any existing evaluation theory to guide their work&hellip;many people conducting evaluation rely on informal theory, derived from their experiences and ideas about evaluation&hellip;or use theories offered by their own professional disciplines rather than those offered by the evaluation community (p.2).</p>

            <p>Will Shadish in his 1997 presidential address to the American Evaluation Association argues that evaluation theory is 'who we are' and that 'all evaluators should know evaluation theory because it is central to our professional identity' (p.1). He goes on to say that:</p>

            <p class="blockquote">If you do not know much about evaluation theory, you are not an evaluator. You may be a great methodologist, a wonderful philosopher, or a very effective program manager. But you are not an evaluator. To be an evaluator, you need to know thae knowledge base that makes the field unique. That unique knowledge base is evaluation theory (pp. 6-7).</p>

            <p>Next we examine one of the most influential frameworks for thinking about evaluation theory.</p>

            <p>Shadish, Cook and Leviton (1991) structure their book around three stages in the development of evaluation theory. They suggest that the earliest developments in evaluation theory focused on the logic and methodology of valuing and knowing and choose as their exemplars the work of Michael Scriven and Don Campbell. In the middle stage they suggest that the focus of theoretical development turned to theories of use and strategies for responding to the needs of policy makers. For this stage they choose as exemplars the work of Carol Weiss, Joseph Wholey and Robert Stake. The final stage with which they are concerned involved the development of integrated, coherent evaluation approaches. For this they looked to Peter Rossi and Lee Cronbach.</p>

                            <p>This material is at times a bit dense and challenging but well worth the effort. Well, at least I think so!! Perhaps we can debate this in the online forum &ndash; see Activity 1.2 below.</p>

               <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>We can respond to the perspectives offered by Shadish, Cook and Leviton by formulating a number of questions we might ask about any evaluation perspective that we examine.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What kinds of knowledge and evaluation practices (methods) are 'privileged' by this perspective?</li>
                <li>What relationship between facts and values does this perspective imply?</li>
                <li>How are factual claims validated (or made 'credible' or 'authenticated' etc.) in this perspective?</li>
                <li>Are value claims validated in this perspective? If so, how?</li>
                <li class="dev">Is generalisation an issue for this perspective? If so how is generalisation conceptualised?</li>
                <li>What is the role of the evaluator in this perspective?</li>
                <li>What is 'good evaluation' from this perspective?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Perhaps the time since 1991, when Shadish, Cook and Leviton published their analysis, can be viewed as a period of maturation and sophistication. It is a period less characterised by major new emphases and heated controversies than the previous three decades. It is a period when the idealism associated with various strategies has been greatly tempered, where a planned eclecticism of approach probably holds sway. The 1990's have also been a period when the debates that occurred in evaluation through the 70's and 80's are being repeated in the processes of public decision-making and where evaluators are often required to educate and arbitrate using their knowledge of past controversies.</p>

                        <p>Evaluation theory is important for several reasons, although perhaps most importantly it serves as a guide to practice. This point is well made by Mel Mark (2005), who states that:</p>
            
                        <p class="blockquote">Learning the latest methodological advance&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s some new statistical adjustment for selection bias or the most recent technique to facilitate stakeholder dialogue&mdash;without knowing the relevant theory is a bit like learning what to do without knowing why or when. What you risk is the equivalent of becoming really skilled at tuning your car&rsquo;s engine without thinking about whether your transportation needs involve going across town, overseas, or to the top of a skyscraper (p.3).</p>
            
                        <p>Another way of answering this question is to consider the relationship between evaluation theory and methodology. No single research design, methodology or method of data collection is appropriate always and everywhere. Strict adherence to one approach is likely to result in data that is of little use. It may also lead to inaccurate conclusions about the merit or worth of the programme or policy that is being evaluated.</p>

                            <p>Can you think of an example, perhaps from your own work, where knowledge of evaluation theory was helpful?</p>

                            <p>How might your views/values about these five dimensions of evaluation theory influence the way in which you conduct an evaluation?</p>

              <p>Knowledge of evaluation theory encourages appreciation of the range of approaches, methods and techniques that can be employed by practising evaluators. It also provides guiding principles for their application across the range of scenarios that evaluators are confronted with. According to Shadish et al. (1991):</p>
            
                        <p class="blockquote">Evaluation theories are like military strategies and tactics; methods are like military weapons and logistics. The good commander needs to know strategy and tactics to deploy weapons properly or to organise logistics in different situations. The good evaluator needs theories for the same reasons in choosing and deploying methods. Without thorough grounding in evaluation theory, the evaluator is left to trial and error or to professional lore in learning about appropriate methods. (p. 34)</p>
            
                        <p>In a similar vein, Stufflebeam and Shinkfield (2007) remind us that evaluation theory is worth knowing because poor theories of evaluation can mislead evaluation practice, resulting in serious negative consequences. They use as an example, the development of objectives-based evaluation theory. This approach was promoted by Ralph Tyler in the 1930s, and grew out of his work on the effects of large-scale educational innovation. Objective- or goal-based evaluation narrowly defines the purpose of evaluation as the process of determining whether or not a programme has achieved specified outcomes. This &lsquo;theory&rsquo; of evaluation misled evaluators for decades as there was a strong tendency to focus only on intended outcomes, not on the actual outcomes (positive or negative) that a particular programme might be generating.</p>
