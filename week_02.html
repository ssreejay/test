                           <p>The purpose of this session is to sketch out some major theoretical developments in the relatively short history of evaluation. I do this in two ways – by presenting various systems for classifying evaluation and introducing several major figures whose writings have significantly impacted the field. The decision to include a particular theorist or evaluation classification system is based on a close reading of the literature, but I make no claims to be definitive or exhaustive.</p>

                                 <p>Numerous people have attempted to classify evaluation activities. The criteria for classification range from the philosophical to the practical. The former distinguish broad varieties or ‘paradigms’ of evaluation on the basis of different ways of looking at the world as well as ideas about how the social world can be understood (i.e. epistemological, ontological and axiological assumptions).</p>
                                 <p>Pawson and Tilley (1997) identify five approaches to evaluation and their most notable advocates:</p>
                                 <ul class="blockquote">
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">The Experimental (Don Campbell)</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">The Pragmatic (Carol Weiss, but also Lee Cronbach)</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">Constructivism/Naturalism (Egon Guba and Yvonna Lincoln)</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">Comprehensive/Pluralist Evaluation (Peter Rossi, Lee Cronbach)</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">Scientific (transcendental, critical) Realism (themselves).</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p>They adopt a common framework for comparing these various schools of evaluation. A basic distinction is made between (1) the methodological strategy; which includes the following ingredients:.</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Epistemology: justifications for knowledge claims</li>
                                    <li>Method: how knowledge is constructed</li>
                                    <li>Ontology: the nature of reality</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p>and (2) the assumptions about policy implementation, which includes views about the nature of social programs, the way in which programs are refined and how knowledge is used.</p>
                                 <p>In a recent text, Program Evaluation Theory and Practice, Mertens and Wilson (2012) present a category system that is organised according to what they see as four major philosophies in evaluation. These are labelled the post-positivist, pragmatic, constructivist and transformative paradigms.</p>
                                 <p class="blockquote">The <strong>post-positivist</strong> paradigm emphasises methods and prioritises quantitative/experimental designs and data collection techniques. The social world (read programs) can be studied in roughly the same way as the natural world (i.e. in a value-free way to produce causal explanations)  Examples they provide of evaluation theorists in this camp are Donald Campbell, Thomas Cook, Will Shadish, Lee Cronbach, Peter Rossi, Mel Mark, Huey-Tsyh Chen, Mark Lipsey and Stuart Donaldson, among others.</p>
                                 <p class="blockquote">The pragmatic <strong>paradigm</strong> focuses on use and encourages the collection of mixed data methods that are seen to be credible and valuable by stakeholders. Reality is viewed as individually interpreted and method choice guided largely by evaluation purpose/questions. Some notable examples of evaluators operating within this tradition are Daniel Stufflebeam, Carol Weiss, Joseph Wholey, Eleanor Chelimsky, David Fetterman and Michael Patton.</p>
                                 <p class="blockquote">The <strong>constructivist paradigm</strong> sees valuing as central and highlights the importance of identifying multiple stakeholder perspectives/realities, primarily through the use of qualitative methods and techniques. Knowledge is socially constructed by people and does not exist ‘out there’ in the external world. Examples of values-based theorists are Michael Scriven, Elliot Eisner, Robert Stake, Egon Guba, Yvonna Lincoln, Ian Shaw, Michael Parlett and David Hamilton. Note that although Scriven has written much about valuing, he does not subscribe to a constructive philosophy.</p>
                                 <p class="blockquote">Finally, the <strong>transformative</strong> (a.k.a. critical/emancipatory) paradigm is concerned with promoting social justice and human rights. Transformative evaluators seek to capture the voice of marginalised groups through mixed methods.  The ultimate aim is to highlight power imbalances and inequities in the way programs, organisations and institutions are structured. Examples of theorists who are said to espouse this view are Donna Mertens, Barry McDonald, Ernest House, Thomas Schwandt, Saville Kushner, Jennifer Greene, and Rodney Hopson.</p>

                                 <p>In contrast to Pawson and Tilley’s polemical analysis, Mertens and Wilson present a more balanced view of the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective (although some evaluators might look upon their presentation of each paradigm as an overly simplistic caricature). They also acknowledge that the boundaries between different worldviews are not always so clear-cut. Evaluators often draw on multiple aspects of each paradigm to inform and guide practice. Even so, it is interesting to note that both books present their own ‘paradigm’ as last in the evolutionary process, implying perhaps that this perspective is superior to earlier positions..</p>

                                 <p>In the book Evaluation Roots: Tracing Theorists’ Views and Influences Marvin Alkin and Christina Christie (2004) use the metaphor of an evaluation theory tree to examine the origins and evolution of evaluation. The ‘tree’ has been revised and updated most recently in a 2nd edition of the book to capture additional theorists’ as well as accommodate criticisms that the original inventory was too narrow, and perhaps even culturally biased toward white, male American evaluation scholars. Alkin and Christie’s depiction centres on the notion that the roots of evaluation can be located within (a) social science research methodology and (b) concerns about accountability that arose following massive federal expenditure on the Great Society Reforms in the 1950s.</p>
                                 <p>The three branches of the tree reflect their main classificatory schema. They argue that evaluation theories can be classified by the extent to which they focus on methods, use or valuing..</p>

                                 <p>The Spring 2001 edition of New Directions for Program Evaluation is a special edition containing a description and critique of twenty-two evaluation approaches by Daniel Stufflebeam<a href="#" class="dev">(The whole edition is one large chapter and cannot be reproduced for students)</a>. His process of establishing criteria and grading each approach according to these criteria is of interest and his choice of criteria provides an interesting checklist of issues students may wish to consider in forming their own philosophies on evaluation. His choice of criteria is also an interesting study in how the value-driven choice of focus drives what is eventually constructed as knowledge.</p>
                                 <p>A more recent version of Stufflebeam’s classification schema is presented in his 2007 book Evaluation Theory, Models & Applications that he co-authored with Anthony Shinkfield. Here Stufflebeam and Shinkfield identify 26 evaluation approaches that are grouped into five conceptual orientations:</p>
                                 <p class="blockquote">1.    Pseudoevaluations<br>
                                    2.  Questions-and Methods-Oriented Evaluation Approaches (Quasi-Evaluation Studies)<br>
                                    3.  Improvement-and-Accountability-Oriented Evaluation Approaches<br>
                                    4.  Social Agenda and Advocacy Approaches and<br>
                                    5.  Eclectic Evaluation Approaches
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Chapter 2 of this book also contains a useful discussion of the nature of evaluation theory, as well as different approaches for developing more descriptive theories of evaluation.</p>

                              <p>We could keep on enumerating classificatory schema. In the fourth edition of their popular evaluation textbook Fitzpatrick, Sanders and Worthen (1973/2011) examine five major orientations (expertise, consumer, program, decision and participant) and associated approaches. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (1979/2004) classify evaluation into five major types that are selected based on consideration of stage of program development, amongst other factors. House (1980) identifies eight main models and offers a comprehensive cross-model comparison based on factors such as major audience, methodology, expected outcome and typical questions. Guba and Lincoln (1989) discuss four ‘generations’ of evaluation. Owen (1993/2006) outlines five main forms and several associated evaluation approaches. Øvretveit (1998) specifies four evaluation purposes and six main designs and the Swedish evaluator Evert Vedung (2010) recently discussed four main ‘waves’ of evaluation diffusion.</p>
                              <p>You are encouraged to read about these and other alternative systems for classifying evaluation. However, for the purposes of this subject we will be focusing largely on the historical and theoretical schema proposed by Shadish, Cook and Leviton (1991), as well as Alkin and Christie’s (2004) ‘theory tree’.</p>

                                    <p>The British evaluator Ian Shaw (1999) once noted that developing a list of ‘big names’ in evaluation is problematic because ‘listing who should be in and who out is a risky business’ (p.19). However, few would argue with the placement of Donald Campbell at or near the very top of any list, given his enormous contributions to the field. This session’s classic reading is Campbell’s (1969) highly influential ‘Reforms as Experiments’</p>
                                    <p>This article which was first published in the American Psychologist in 1969. He later developed these ideas in a series of additional papers that collectively speak to his ‘Vision of an experimenting society’. Is Campbell too much of an idealist? What is wrong with his somewhat Utopian view for the role of evaluation in society?</p>
