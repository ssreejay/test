                           <p>This session explores the nature and role of values in evaluation. Most simply stated, evaluation involves the use of systematically gathered information in order to make a judgement about the value (merit, worth, or significance) of something. One of the most basic conflicts in the evaluation literature with regard to valuing relates to whether there can be any sort of objective basis for valuing. A second and related controversy focuses on whether it can ever be justified for evaluators to align themselves with one stakeholder position against another. We will examine the implications of these two issues for evaluation practice.</p>

                                 <p>Scepticism towards values has dominated science since at least the 17th century. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was the first to attempt a description of ‘the scientific method’. He promoted a demarcation between science and non-science and argued that the distinguishing feature of the scientific method was that it was based on presuppositionless observation. In particular he argued that scientists must free themselves from four sorts of idols related, roughly, to culture, personal predispositions, ill-fitting pre-existing concepts (constructs) and the constraints of particular philosophical systems. To Bacon science involved “cleansing of the mind of all its presuppositions and prejudices, and reading the book of nature with fresh eyes” (Blaikie, 1993, p. 134).</p>
                                 <p>The philosopher, David Hume (1711–1776) popularised the view that ‘values’ (normative statements about merit and worth) cannot be derived from ‘facts’ (descriptive statements of what is). This is sometimes referred to as the ‘is-ought’ problem or Hume’s Guillotine. According to this perspective, a distinction must be maintained between facts and values, with the latter being systematically ‘walled off’ from having any influence.  </p>
                                 <p>The ‘fact-value’ distinction or ‘values-free’ doctrine has had a profound influence on social research and evaluation. Although evaluators generally accept that facts and values are intertwined, and cannot be neatly separated, evaluators still struggle to understand the nature and role of valuing. When engaging with values, evaluators often look to theory or systematic observation, or some combination of both.</p>
                                 <p>Drawing evaluation criteria from a theoretically developed ethical perspective is referred to as <strong>prescriptive valuing</strong>. Drawing criteria from values expressed by stakeholders is called <strong>descriptive valuing</strong>.</p>

                                 <p>Prescriptive theories of value have received considerable emphasis in philosophy and economics but little in evaluation. Typically evaluators have advocated a descriptive approach in which goals or criteria are clarified with stakeholders. Even in evaluation, however, particular ethical perspectives can be seen in choices made at every stage of the evaluation—it is just that they are usually unacknowledged and uncritiqued. For example, even in an evaluation that focuses on the stated goals of a program as determined by managers, utilitarian principles underlie the choice of an outcome focus and most probably the choice of allegiance to those who are perceived to have the power to make decisions.</p>

                                 <p>Shadish et al. (1991) argue that Scriven’s focus on needs analysis and “functional analysis” as the source of criteria for evaluation is essentially prescriptive in that it seeks to privilege certain value claims above others (pp. 96-99). Scriven is whole-heartedly consequentialist in his orientation but favours a “justice as fairness” perspective over pure utilitarianism as the basis for determining ‘need’. Scriven’s strong rejection of ‘goals’ as a source of evaluation criteria is markedly anti-descriptive</p>
                                 <p>Also, in insisting that evaluators attempt a “synthesis” resulting in a single statement about the merit of a program, Scriven requires evaluators to utilise criteria for weighting and adjudicating between value claims—criteria that would normally be developed from some prescriptive framework. Scriven’s approach differs from other prescriptive approaches in that it seeks to derive criteria empirically and inductively rather than through deductive reason, as is the common approach of philosophers and economists. He is searching for a ‘science of valuing’, and empirical ethics that goes beyond the mere collation of stakeholder preferences. The methodology of this science is unclear but it has something to do with describing the nature of human needs and the essential function of objects/programs in relation to those needs. The program is judged by the extent to which it meets those functions without deleterious side effects.  </p>

                                                <p>Scriven often implies that evaluators who do not provide an evaluative conclusion are shirking their professional responsibilities. They are ‘playing at evaluation’ and are not seriously committed to the job. You may recall from your introductory studies the general working logic that Scriven advocates for arriving at objective conclusions and summative value judgments: (1) Establish criteria of merit; (2) set standards of performance; (3) measure performance; and (4) synthesize results into a value statement.</p>

                                                  <p>Consider the following comment from Scriven’s (1971) early writing about educational evaluation:</p>
                                                  <p class="blockquote">“They [evaluators] sometimes sound as if they stopped in midstride. Why don’t they sum the evaluation up and just say the project was, for example, a practically unqualified failure, as it often is? Because of the possibility of hurting feelings? As an evaluator, that’s irresponsible; your obligation is to the funding agency, and ultimately the taxpayer, and not to the educational project being evaluated. Medical and industrial researchers have their feelings hurt all the time—most innovations are unsuccessful—but we don’t want dangerous or useless drugs or devices on the market, hence the regulatory commissions. The educational evaluator needs to remember he’s the public protector in this area. It’s his task to condense the mass of data into one word: good, or bad. Sometimes this really is impossible, but all too often the failure to do so is simply a cop-out disguised as or rationalized as objectivity, or description rather than prescription!” (Scriven 1971: p. 53)</p>
                                                  <p>What do you make of this view? Have you conducted an evaluation, or are you aware of an evaluation, where a ‘bottom-line’ judgement along these lines has been provided?</p>
                                                  <p>Is Scriven right to be critical of evaluations that do not deliver judgements of value, worth or merit?</p>

                           <p>While prescriptive ethical systems influence evaluators in many ways of which they may not be aware, the explicit processes for development of evaluation criteria are usually descriptive. That is, they involve procedures that determine what particular stakeholder groups think should occur and should be the basis for judging the program. This is probably an activity with which social scientists feel more at home than with philosophical debate.</p>
                           <p>There are numerous procedures that have been identified to tap the opinions of individuals and groups. Trochim’s (YEAR) concept mapping technique is one example of a systematic and robust process for identifying stakeholder values. By far the most common approach to descriptive valuing is, however, to simply accept the stated goals of the program as the criteria by which the program should be judged. Unfortunately the dangers of such an approach are immense as goals are usually written for purposes other than elucidating what the program can really be expected to achieve (such as obtaining funding). Wholey and Patton (YEAR) among others have emphasised the need to carefully review goals and formulate them in realistic terms both in relation to the programs theory of action and the resources and knowledge available.</p>

                           <p>As we have seen, value claims, as with knowledge claims are formulated through a combination of empirically derived information and deductive reason. Any set of values adopted as the basis for judgement in evaluation will involve both descriptive and prescriptive elements, although, the prescriptive elements are frequently not conscious let alone explicit.</p>
                           <p>Shadish et al. (1991) criticise Scriven for his emphasis on prescriptive theory and argue that they give priority to descriptive theory with prescriptive theory in predominantly a safeguard role providing a “source of discipline about criteria and about ethical implications of certain choices” (p 98). Their concerns with prescriptive theories are:</p>
                            <ul class="blockquote">
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">there is no agreed ethical framework but rather many competing frameworks all with strong arguments in their favour</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">prescriptive theories are not operational in most-decision-making and are therefore likely to be of little interest and use to policy makers</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">the contesting of values is the role of political processes, a role that should not be usurped by the evaluator</li>
                                    <li class="blockquote_li">the ‘public interest’ perspective that Scriven advocates as the basis for needs identification is ill defined.)</li>
                                 </ul>
                              <p>Scriven’s opinion in relation to these concerns is reflected in his view that the purely descriptive approach to valuing reflects ‘the lackey view of evaluation research’. Scriven would argue that in aligning themselves with ‘decision-makers’ evaluators have made a series of de facto value and ethical judgements and risk co-option in the perpetuation of injustice. House and Howe (1999) express similar concerns. This leads us into the issue of competing stakeholder perspectives and the decision by evaluators to align themselves with one or another perspective.</p>

                        <p>The issue of alignment not only affects the source of evaluation criteria but also how and to whom the evaluation reports. Not surprisingly the authors listed under the consumerist heading in the above table tend to advocate the widest possible distribution of evaluation findings where the others are more likely to favour private reports and briefings.</p>
                          <p>Scriven, in contrast to his unwillingness to draw criteria directly from stakeholders, advocates distributing a draft report to the widest possible range of stakeholders to obtain the greatest possible range of perspectives. He suggests then including their critiques, interpretations and comments in the final report.</p>

Incidentally, this series later revised its title to New Directions for Evaluation at the urging of Scriven.</p>
                                    <p><em>Hard-Won Lessons</em> is organised around thirty-one ‘theses’ (more like aphorisms) that are grouped into categories. I have provided Chapter 1 only. It is the lengthiest and most substantive of the seven chapters, and is perhaps the finest exposition of Scriven’s dogged perspective on the nature and fundamentals of evaluation.</p>
                                    <p>The volume may have partly been inspired as a counterpoint to Lee J. Cronbach and associates' (1980) earlier and equally provocative ninety-five theses on evaluation, that were articulated at length in the book <em>Toward Reform of Program Evaluation.</em> Scriven clearly disagrees with Cronbach’s applied social science approach to evaluation (see especially, pp.40-41). Written in characteristic Scrivenesque style, Hard-Won Lessons contains gems such as: “Side effects are often the main point” (p. ref), “An evaluation without a recommendation is like a fish without a bicycle” (p. ref), and “One can only attain fourth-generation evaluation by counting backward” (p. ref).</p>
